## NYC School Regents Performance

This project is designed to visualize the performance of NYC schools on the annual NYS Regents exams. The NYS Regents exams are assessments across English, math, science, 
history, and foreign language given to high school students three times a year in January, June, and August. Students must pass a sufficient number of exams in each subject 
area in order to earn their high school diploma. The NYC Department of Education posts school-based performance data on the tests on a regular basis. Using React and PostgreSQL, 
we are creating a website that allows users to visualize the exam performance from 2017 to 2023 (excluding 2020 and 2021).
