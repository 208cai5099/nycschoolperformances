## NYC School Regents Performance Website

This project is designed to provide information about the performance of New York City (NYC) public schools on the New York State (NYS) Regents exams. 
The NYS Regents exams are assessments in English, math, science, social studies, and foreign language. They are given to high school students three times a 
year in January, June, and August. Students generally must pass a sufficient number of exams in each subject area in order to earn their high school diploma. 
The NYC Department of Education posts school-based performance data on the tests on a regular basis.

Using React, we created a website (https://208cai5099.github.io/nycschoolperformances/) that allows users to visualize the exam performance from 2017 to 2023 (excluding 2020 and 2021).

The homepage welcomes users to explore the performance data of NYC public schools.

Users can select multiple schools (up to 10) and visualize their performances on a specific exam.
